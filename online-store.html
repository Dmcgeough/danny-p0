            <h4>Harriet Vanger, a scion of one of Sweden's wealthiest families disappeared over forty years ago. 
                All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist, 
                a crusading journalist recently trapped by a libel conviction, to investigate. 
                He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander. 
                Together they tap into a vein of unfathomable iniquity and astonishing corruption.</h4>

            <h4>Former military cop Jack Reacher makes it all the way from snowbound South Dakota to his destination in 
                northeastern Virginia, near Washington, D.C.: the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP. 
                The old stone building is the closest thing to a home he ever had.
                Reacher is there to meet—in person—the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner, 
                so far just a warm, intriguing voice on the phone.
                But it isn’t Turner behind the CO’s desk. And Reacher is hit with two pieces of shocking news, 
                one with serious criminal consequences, and one too personal to even think about.
                When threatened, you can run or fight.
                Reacher fights, aiming to find Turner and clear his name, barely a step ahead of the army, and the FBI, 
                and the D.C. Metro police, and four unidentified thugs.
                Combining an intricate puzzle of a plot and an exciting chase for truth and justice, 
                Lee Child puts Reacher through his paces—and makes him question who he is, what he’s done, 
                and the very future of his untethered life on the open road.</h4>

            <h4>There have been nineteen years of blood. The ruthless Grand Duke Orso is locked in a vicious struggle with 
                the squabbling League of Eight, and between them they have bled the land white. While armies march, heads roll and 
                cities burn, and behind the scenes bankers, priests and older, darker powers play a deadly game to 
                choose who will be king.
                War may be hell but for Monza Murcatto, the Snake of Talins, the most feared and famous mercenary in Duke Orso's employ, 
                it's a damn good way of making money too. Her victories have made her popular - 
                a shade too popular for her employer's taste. Betrayed, thrown down a mountain and left for dead, Murcatto's reward 
                is a broken body and a burning hunger for vengeance. Whatever the cost, seven men must die.
                Her allies include Styria's least reliable drunkard, Styria's most treacherous poisoner, a mass-murderer 
                obsessed with numbers and a Northman who just wants to do the right thing. 
                Her enemies number the better half of the nation. And that's all before the most dangerous man in the world is dispatched to hunt her down and finish the job Duke Orso started...
                Springtime in Styria. And that means revenge.</h4>

            <h4>Douglas Brinkley presents the definitive, revealing biography of an American legend: renowned news anchor 
                Walter Cronkite.
                An acclaimed author and historian, Brinkley has drawn upon recently disclosed letters, diaries, 
                and other artifacts at the recently opened Cronkite Archive to bring detail and depth to this deeply personal portrait.
                He also interviewed nearly two hundred of Cronkite’s closest friends and colleagues, 
                including Andy Rooney, Leslie Stahl, Barbara Walters, Dan Rather, Brian Williams, Les Moonves, 
                Christiane Amanpour, Katie Couric, Bob Schieffer, Ted Turner, Jimmy Buffett, and Morley Safer, 
                using their voices to instill dignity and humanity in this study of one of 
                America’s most beloved and trusted public figures.</h4>
