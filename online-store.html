                All these years later, her aged uncle continues to seek the truth. He hires Mikael Blomkvist,

                He is aided by the pierced and tattooed punk prodigy Lisbeth Salander.

            <h4>Former military cop Jack Reacher makes it all the way from snowbound South Dakota to his destination in 
                northeastern Virginia, near Washington, D.C.: the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP. 
                The old stone building is the closest thing to a home he ever had.
                Reacher is there to meet—in person—the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner, 
                so far just a warm, intriguing voice on the phone.
                But it isn’t Turner behind the CO’s desk. And Reacher is hit with two pieces of shocking news, 
                one with serious criminal consequences, and one too personal to even think about.
                When threatened, you can run or fight.
                Reacher fights, aiming to find Turner and clear his name, barely a step ahead of the army, and the FBI, 
                and the D.C. Metro police, and four unidentified thugs.
                Combining an intricate puzzle of a plot and an exciting chase for truth and justice, 
                Lee Child puts Reacher through his paces—and makes him question who he is, what he’s done, 
                and the very future of his untethered life on the open road.</h4>

            <h4>There have been nineteen years of blood. The ruthless Grand Duke Orso is locked in a vicious struggle with 
                the squabbling League of Eight, and between them they have bled the land white. While armies march, heads roll and 
                cities burn, and behind the scenes bankers, priests and older, darker powers play a deadly game to 
                choose who will be king.
                War may be hell but for Monza Murcatto, the Snake of Talins, the most feared and famous mercenary in Duke Orso's employ, 
                it's a damn good way of making money too. Her victories have made her popular - 
                a shade too popular for her employer's taste. Betrayed, thrown down a mountain and left for dead, Murcatto's reward 
                is a broken body and a burning hunger for vengeance. Whatever the cost, seven men must die.
                Her allies include Styria's least reliable drunkard, Styria's most treacherous poisoner, a mass-murderer 
                obsessed with numbers and a Northman who just wants to do the right thing. 
                Her enemies number the better half of the nation. And that's all before the most dangerous 
                man in the world is dispatched to hunt her down and finish the job Duke Orso started...
                Springtime in Styria. And that means revenge.</h4>

            <h4>When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, 
                she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is 
                startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate 
                to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, 
                Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.
                Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. 
                For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, 
                his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. 
                When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, 
                Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.

            <h4>It was a typical evening at a mall outside Portland, Maine. Three teenage friends waited for the movie to start.
                 A boy flirted with the girl selling sunglasses. Mothers and children shopped together, 
                 and the manager at video game store tended to customers. Then the shooters arrived.
                The chaos and carnage lasted only eight minutes before the killers were taken down. 
                But for those who lived through it, the effects would last forever. In the years that followed, 
                one would dedicate himself to a law enforcement career. Another would close herself off, trying to bury 
                the memory of huddling in a ladies' room, helplessly clutching her cell phone--until she finally found 
                a way to pour her emotions into her art.
                But one person wasn't satisfied with the shockingly high death toll at the DownEast Mall. 
                And as the survivors slowly heal, find shelter, and rebuild, they will discover that another conspirator 
                is lying in wait--and this time, there might be nowhere safe to hide.</h4>

            <h4>Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in The Soul of America Meacham shows us how what 
                Abraham Lincoln called the “better angels of our nature” have repeatedly won the day. 
                Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, 
                Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, 
                and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as 
                Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers 
                Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer 
                Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. 
                He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; 
                the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan 
                in the 1920s; the fight for women’s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin 
                and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist 
                witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson’s crusade against Jim Crow. 
                Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the 
                country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear—a struggle that continues even now.
                While the American story has not always—or even often—been heroic, we have been sustained by a 
                belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, 
                “The good news is that we have come through such darkness before”—as, time and again, 
                Lincoln’s better angels have found a way to prevail.</h4>

            <h4>Something sinister is going on in Baronville. The rust belt town has seen four bizarre murders in the 
                space of two weeks. Cryptic clues left at the scenes--obscure bible verses, odd symbols--have the police stumped.
                Amos Decker and his FBI colleague Alex Jamison are in Baronville visiting Alex's sister and her family. 
                It's a bleak place: a former mill and mining town with a crumbling economy and rampant opioid addiction. 
                Decker has only been there a few hours when he stumbles on a horrific double murder scene. 
                Then the next killing hits sickeningly close to home. And with the lives of people he cares about 
                suddenly hanging in the balance, Decker begins to realize that the recent string of deaths may be only 
                one small piece of a much larger scheme--with consequences that will reach far beyond Baronville. 
                Decker, with his singular talents, may be the only one who can crack this bizarre case. 
                Only this time--when one mistake could cost him everything--Decker finds that his previously 
                infallible memory may not be so trustworthy after all... </h4>
