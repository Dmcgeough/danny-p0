// create an array that isn't hard coded with values that can be changed with above function to be true or false which in turn
// would represent whether the text inside of the button says 'bought' or 'buy'. Following creating that function after building
// the correct array I would need to create another function that will take the book title and book price from the array and
// inject that into a table in order to show the book title and its price in the shopping cart page after it is clicked on in
// the store page. A final bit of javascript that it would be helpful to add would be a loop of some sort to add up all of the 
// books 'bought' and to figure out a way to add them all up and put them into a total price table data element on the shopping
// cart page. The function to add up price would be fairly straight forward. However, the function that would require me to
//pull values from an Array and then inject those values using JavaScript into a different HTML element is going to be tough.
//var book = [title, price];
