        <article>
            From a very young age, I was always reading. When in Elementary school I would walk from class to class with a
            book tucked under my arm and during the time in between math and science I would be reading. My voracious appetite
            for books stemmed from a desire to put myself in a different world and was a form of escapism during my early years.
            Getting lost in examples of the written word was a desire that only intensified as I grew up. It engendered in me a
            deep love for books and the scenarios and worlds that the authors so artfully crafted and then distributed to their
            audiences. They could create feelings of love, fear, excitement or one of a hundred other emotions found within the 
            pages of their works.
            <br><br>
            It was this respect and admiration for authors and their work that led me to open this bookstore. I believe that 
            everybody needs a bit of an escape from daily life. Maybe dive into the world of an explorer visiting parts unknown 
            or a hero adventuring through a world that is equal parts danger and excitement. Or if fiction is too far-fetched
            for you, a biography can tell you the life story of some of the people who shaped the world around them and had 
            profound effects on our world view and a way of looking things that may be different to ones own. It can also be used
            as an educational tool to broaden ones academic horizons by teaching you not only important concepts, but also
            expanding ones own vocabulary and giving a different perspective.
            <br><br> 
            To figure out an authors motivations it prompted readers to step back from their own biases and belief systems and
            to step into the shoes of a character to try to understand why they do what they do and the reasons behind it. Authors
            are also adept at providing an underlining theme or commentary that will influence people without them even knowing
            about it and it is for those reasons and others that I opened this store.
            <br><br>
            I want to help foster a love of reading in anyone who visits my store or buys a book from me. It is up to the reader
            to keep asking questions and develop a curious nature to continuously enrich themselves and their literary pursuits. 
            Every time you crack open a book you are embarking on an adventure that can hold onto you and push you to keep reading
            to figure out what happens next. My mission can be summed up in one simple statement: "Reading is a basic tool in the living 
            of a good life." -Joseph Addison
